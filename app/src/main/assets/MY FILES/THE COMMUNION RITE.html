In the United States, the people normally process to the front in lines, receive communion standing, and then return to their places in the congregation. In some cases, the ministers may go to other locations within the church to distribute communion, or may even approach individuals at their places (esp. the elderly or infirm). Communion is now usually offered "under both species", i.e., both the consecrated bread and the consecrated wine.&nbsp;</em><em>It may be distributed by priests, deacons, or designated lay persons, called "Extraordinary Ministers of the Eucharist." Communicants are encouraged to receive the consecrated bread in their hands, but may also receive communion on the tongue. After returning to their places, the people are encouraged to remain standing until everyone has received communion, but in many parishes the people immediately sit down or kneel for silent prayer.</em>]</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Communion Minister</em>:</span>&nbsp;The body of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Communicant</em>:</span>&nbsp;Amen.</strong><br /><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Communion Minister</em>:</span>&nbsp;The blood of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Communicant</em>:</span>&nbsp;Amen.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Communion Song:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>[<em>During the reception of Communion, an appropriate song is sung, or at least a short "Communion Antiphon" is recited.</em>]</p> </blockquote> <p><span style="color: #990000;">[sit]</span><br /><strong>Period of Silence</strong>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<strong>Song of Praise:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>[<em>When the distribution of Communion is completed, there may be a period of silence for individual prayer, or a psalm or song of praise may be sung.
